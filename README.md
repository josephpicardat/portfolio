# Portfolio

This is my portfolio for the Module 2 Challenge. I went and researched a lot about how and why certain htlm and css properties work alone and with each other. This challenge took me longer than usual due to my creativity. I always wondering, what can I add to this to make it minimilistic yet cool. I did not achieve everything I wanted and had to cut my work on it too short (a week past due date). Most of my time on this challenge was figuring out why my code didn't work and then getting the amazing "eureka moment." 

!!!!!!!!!!MAKE SURE TO TEST OUT THE FORM SECTION!! VERY IMPORTANT!! WORTH WHILE!!!!!!!!!
